# Worker node
Before you follow the steps in this chapter, we assume you have installed the required [dependencies](./dependencies.md) and installed [`branectl`](./branectl.md), as discussed in the previous two chapters.

If you did, then you are ready to install a worker node. This chapter will explain you how to do that.


## Obtaining images
Just as with `branectl` itself, there are two ways of obtaining the Docker images: downloading them from the repository or compiling them. Note, however, that multiple files should be downloaded; and to aid with this, the `branectl` executable can be used to automate the downloading process for you.

> <img src="../../assets/img/info.png" alt="info" width="16" style="margin-top: 3px; margin-bottom: -3px"/> In the future, a third option might be to download the standard images from [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/). However, due to the experimental nature of the framework, the images are not yet published. Instead, rely on `branectl` to make the process easy for you.


### Downloading prebuilt images
The recommended way to download the Brane images is to use `branectl`. These will download the images to `.tar` files, which can be send around at your leisure.

Run the following command to download the Brane service images for a worker node:
```bash
# Download the images
branectl download services worker -f
```
(the `-f` will automatically create missing directories for the target output path)

Once these complete successfully, you should have the images for the worker node in the directory `target/release`. While this path may be changed, it is recommended to stick to the default to make the commands in subsequent sections easier.

> <img src="../../assets/img/info.png" alt="info" width="16" style="margin-top: 3px; margin-bottom: -3px"/> By default, `branectl` will download the version for which it was compiled. However, you can change this with the `--version` option:
> ```bash
> branectl download services worker -f --version 1.0.0
> ```
> 
> Note, however, that not every Brane version may have the same services or the same method of downloading, and so this option may fail. Download the `branectl` for the desired version instead for a more reliable experience.


### Compiling the images
The other way to obtain the images is to compile them yourself. If you want to do so, refer to the [compilation instructions](/specification/development/compilation.html) over at the [Brane: A Specification](/specification)-book for instructions.


## Generating configuration
Once you have downloaded the images, it is time to setup the configuration files for the node. These files determine the type of node, as well as any of the node's properties and network specifications.

For a worker node, this means generating the following files:
- A backend file (`backend.yml`), which will define how the worker node connects to which backend that will actually execute the tasks;
- A proxy file (`proxy.yml`), which describes if any proxying should occur and how;
- A policy secret for the deliberation API (`policy_deliberation_secret.json`), which contains the private key for accessing the Brane-side of `brane-chk`;
- A policy secret for the policy expert API (`policy_expert_secret.json`), which contains the private key for accessing the management-side of `brane-chk`;
- A policy database (`polocies.db`), which is the persistent storage for `brane-chk`'s policies; and
- A node file (`node.yml`), which will contain the node-specific configuration like service names, ports, file locations, etc.

All of these can be generated with `branectl` for convenience.

We will first generate a `backend.yml` file. This will define how the worker node can connect to the infrastructure that will actually execute incoming containers. Multiple backend types are possible (see the [series of chapters on it](../backends/introduction.md)), but by default, the configuration assumes that work will be executed on the local machine's Docker daemon.

Thus, to generate such a `backend.yml` file, you can use the following command:
```bash
branectl generate backend -f -p ./config/backend.yml local
```

Running this command will generate the file `./config/backend.yml` for you, with default settings for how to connect to the local daemon. If you want to change these, you can simply use more options and flags in the tool itself (see the [`branectl` documentation](TODO) or the builtin `branectl generate backend --help`), or change the file manually (see the [`backend.yml` documentation](../../config/admins/backend.md)).

> <img src="../../assets/img/info.png" alt="info" width="16" style="margin-top: 3px; margin-bottom: -3px"/> While the `-f` flag (`--fix-dirs`, fix missing directories) and the `-p` option (`--path`, path of generated file) are not required, you will typically use these to make your life easier down the road. See the `branectl generate node` command below to find out why.

<!-- Then, we will generate the `policies.yml` file. This is done with a similar command:
```bash
branectl generate policy -f -p ./config/policies.yml
```
Note that the default policy file denies all dataset requests and incoming tasks. It is thus very recommended to manually add some rules yourself; see the [`policies.yml` documentation](../../policy-experts/policy-file.md). -->

<!-- > <img src="../../assets/img/info.png" alt="info" width="16" style="margin-top: 3px; margin-bottom: -3px"/> You can also specify `-a` or `--allow-all` to generate a file that, by default, will allow everything instead of denying it. However, note that doing so is strongly discouraged in production environments; only do so in testing environments. -->

Next up is the `proxy.yml` file. Typically, these can be left to the default settings, and so the following command will do the trick in most situations:
```bash
branectl generate proxy -f -p ./config/proxy.yml
```

A `proxy.yml` file should be available in `./config/proxy.yml` after running this command.

The contents of this file will typically only differ if you have advanced networking requirements. If so, consult the [`branectl` documentation](TODO) or the builtin `branectl generate proxy --help`, or the [`proxy.yml` documentation](../../config/admins/proxy.md).

> <img src="../../assets/img/info.png" alt="info" width="16" style="margin-top: 3px; margin-bottom: -3px"/> This file may be skipped if you are setting up an external proxy node for this node. See the [chapter on proxy nodes](./proxy-node.md) for more information.

Next, we will generate the policy keys. To do so, run the following two commands:
```bash
branectl generate policy_secret -f -p ./config/policy_deliberation_secret.json
branectl generate policy_secret -f -p ./config/policy_expert_secret.json
```
The default settings should suffice. If not, check `branectl generate policy_secret --help` for more information.

Then, we will generate the policy database. This is not a configuration file, but does need to be bootstrapped and explicitly passed to the node's `brane-chk` service. To generate it, run:
```bash
branectl generate policy_db -f -p ./policies.db
```

Finally, we will generate the `node.yml` file. This file is done last, because it itself defines where BRANE software may find any of the others.

When generating this file, it is possible to manually specify where to find each of those files. However, in practise, it is more convenient to make sure that the files are at the default locations that the tools expects. The following tree structure displays the default locations for the configuration of a worker node:
```
<current dir>
├ config
│ ├ certs
│ │ └ <domain certs>
│ ├ backend.yml
│ ├ policy_deliberation_secret.yml
│ ├ policy_expert_secret.yml
│ └ proxy.yml
├ policies.db
└ node.yml
```

The `config/certs` directory will be used to store the certificates for this worker node and any node it wants to download data from. We will do that in the [following section](#generating-certificates).

Assuming that you have the other configuration files stored at their default locations, the following command can be used to create a `node.yml` for a worker node:
```bash
branectl generate node -f worker <HOSTNAME> <LOCATION_ID>
```

Here, the `<HOSTNAME>` is the address where any worker node may reach the central node. Only the hostname will suffice (e.g., `some-domain.com`), but any scheme or path you supply will be automatically stripped away. Then, the `<LOCATION_ID>` is the identifier that the system will use for your location. Accordingly, it must be unique in the instance, and you must choose the same one as defined in the central node of the instance.

The `-f` flag will make sure that any of the missing directories (e.g., `config/certs`) will be generated automatically.

For example, we can generate a `node.yml` file for a worker with the identifier `bob`:
```bash
branectl generate node -f worker 192.0.2.2 bob
```

Once again, you can change many of the properties in the `node.yml` file by specifying additional command-line options (see the [`branectl` documentation](TODO) or the builtin `branectl generate node --help`) or by changing the file manually (see the [`node.yml` documentation](../../config/admins/node.md)).

> <img src="../../assets/img/warning.png" alt="warning" width="16" style="margin-top: 3px; margin-bottom: -3px"/> Due to a  [bug](https://github.com/epi-project/brane/issues/27) in one of the framework's dependencies, it cannot handle certificates on IP addresses. To workaround this issue, the `-H` option is provided; it can be used to specify a certain hostname/IP mapping for this node only. Example:
> ```bash
> # We can address '192.0.2.2' with 'some-domain' now
> branectl generate node -f -H some-domain:192.0.2.2 worker bob-domain.com bob
> ```
> Note that this is local to this domain only; you have to specify this on other nodes as well. For more information, see the [`node.yml` documentation](../../config/admins/node.md).


## Generating certificates
In contrast to setting up a central node, a worker node will have to strongly identify itself to prove to other worker nodes who it is. This is relevant, because worker nodes may want to download data from one another; and if this dataset is private, then the other domains likely won't share it unless they know who they are talking to.

In Brane, the identity of domains is proven by the use of [X.509 certificates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X.509). Thus, before you can start your worker node, we will have to generate some certificates.


### Server-side certificates
Every worker node is required to have at least a certificate authority (CA) certificate and a server certificate. The first is used as the "authority" of the domain, which is used to sign other certificates such that the worker can see that it has been signed by itself in the past. The latter, in contrast, is used to provide the identity of the worker in case it plays the role of a server (some other domain connects to us and requests a dataset).

Once again, we can use the power of `branectl` to generate both of these certificates for us. Use the following command to generate both a certificate autority and server certificate:
```bash
branectl generate certs -f -p ./config/certs server <LOCATION_ID> -H <HOSTNAME>
```
where `<LOCATION_ID>` is the identifier of the worker node (the one configured in the `node.yml` file), and `<HOSTNAME>` is the hostname that other domains can connect to this domain to.

You can omit the `-H <HOSTNAME>` flag to default the hostname to be the same as the `<LOCATION_ID>`. This is useful where you've given manual host mappings when generating the `node.yml` file (i.e., the `-H` option there).

For example, to generate certificates for the domain `amy` that lives at `amy-worker-node.com`:
```bash
branectl generate certs -f -p ./config/certs server amy -H amy-worker-node.com
```
This should generate multiple files in the `./config/certs` directory, chief of which are `ca.pem` and `server.pem`.

> <img src="../../assets/img/info.png" alt="info" width="16" style="margin-top: 3px; margin-bottom: -3px"/> Certificate generation is done using [cfssl](https://github.com/cloudflare/cfssl), which is dynamically downloaded by `branectl`. The checksum of the downloaded file is asserted, and if you ever see a checksum-related error, then you might be dealing with a fake binary that is being downloaded under a real address. In that case, tread with care.

When the certificates are generated, be sure to share `ca.pem` with the central node. If you are also adminstrating that node, see [here](./central-node.md#adding-certificates) for instructions on what to do with it.


### Client-side certificates
The previous certificates only authenticate a server to a client; not the other way around. That is where the client certificates come into play.

The power of client certificates come from the fact that they are signed using the certificate authority of the domain to which they want to authenticate. In other words, the domain has to "approve" that a certain user exists by creating a certificate for them, and then sending it over.

Note, however, that currently, Brane does not use any hostnames or IPs embedded in the client certificate. This means that anyone with the client certificate can obtain access to the domain as if they were the user for which it was issued. Treat the certificates with care, and be sure that the client is also careful with the certificate.

> <img src="../../assets/img/info.png" alt="info" width="16" style="margin-top: 3px; margin-bottom: -3px"/> If a certificate is leaked or compromised, don't worry; the certificate only proves the identity of a user. What kind of rights that user has can be separately determined (see the chapter series for [policy experts](../../policy-experts/introduction.md)), and so you can simply withdraw any rights that user has when it happens.

To generate a client certificate, its easiest to navigate to the `./config/certs` directory where you generate the server certificates. Then, you can run:
```bash
branectl generate certs client <LOCATION_ID> -H <HOSTNAME> -f -p ./client-certs
```
Note, that the `<LOCATION_ID>` is now the ID of the worker _for which you are generating_ the certificate, and `<HOSTNAME>` is their address. Similarly to server certificates, you can omit `-H <HOSTNAME>` to default to the `<LOCATION_ID>`.

> <img src="../../assets/img/warning.png" alt="warning" width="16" style="margin-top: 3px; margin-bottom: -3px"/> Note the `-f` and `-p` options. These are optional, and work together to redirect the output of the commands to a nested folder called `client-certs`. This is however very recommendable, since running this command without that flag in the server certificates folder will accidentally clear the `ca.pem` file, rendering the rest of the certificates useless.

For example, contuining the example in the previous subsection, we now generate a client certificate for `bob` at `bobs-emporium.com`:
```bash
branectl generate certs client bob -H 192.0.2.2
```

Once the client certificates are generated, you can share the `ca.pem` and `client-id.pem` files with the client who intends to connect to this node.


### Adding client certificates of other domains
If your worker node needs to download data from other worker nodes, you will have to add the client certificates they generated to your configuration.

The procedure to do so is identical as for central nodes. For every pair of a `ca.pem` and `client-id.pem` certificates you want to:
1. Create a directory with that domain's name in the `certs` directory (for the example, you would create a directory named `certs/amy` for a domain named `amy`)
2. Move the certificates to that folder.

At runtime, whenever your worker node will need to download a dataset from another worker, it will read the certificates in that worker's folder if they exist to authenticate itself.


## Writing policies
Before you launch the instance, you may want to [change the node's policy](../../policy-experts/managing-policies.md). If not, then the default policy kicks in; which is deny all.

To change which policies are active, the policy experts needs access tokens to authorize themselves. You can generate these by running:
```bash
branectl generate policy_token <INITIATOR> <SYSTEM> <DURATION> -s <PATH_TO_SECRET>
```
where:
- `<INITIATOR>` is the name of the policy expert (or some other identifier);
- `<SYSTEM>` is some identifier for the system that acts on their behalf. Typically, this would be the identifier of the domain they are working for.
- `<DURATION>` is the duration for which the token is valid. You should give it as numbers, with `s` for seconds, `m` for minutes, `d` for days or `y` for years (e.g., `31d`).
- `<PATH_TO_SECRET>` is the path to the relevant policy secret you generated earlier.

Note that the command writes the token to `./policy_token.json`, unless you change the path with `-p`. You can then share this token with the policy expert.

More information to manage policies can be found in the [policy expert's documentation](../../policy-experts/management.md).


## Launching the instance
Finally, now that you have the images and the configuration files, it's time to start the instance.

We assume that you have installed your images to `target/release`. If you have built your images in development mode, however, they will be in `target/debug`; see the box below for the command then.

This can be done with one `branectl` command:
```bash
branectl start worker
```

This will launch the services in the local Docker daemon, which completes the setup!

> <img src="../../assets/img/info.png" alt="info" width="16" style="margin-top: 3px; margin-bottom: -3px"/> The command above assumes default locations for the images (`./target/release`) and for the `node.yml` file (`./node.yml`). If you use non-default locations, however, you can use the following flags:
> - Use `-n` or `--node` to specify another location for the `node.yml` file:
>   ```bash
>   branectl -n <PATH TO NODE YML> start worker
>   ```
>   It will define the rest of the configuration locations.
> - If you have installed all images to another folder than `./target/release` (e.g., `./target/debug`), you can use the quick option `--image-dir` to change the folders. Specifically:
>   ```bash
>   branectl start --image-dir "./target/debug" worker
>   ```
> - You can also specify the location of each image individually. To see how, refer to the [`branectl` documentation](TODO) or the builtin `branectl start --help`.


## Next
Congratulations, you have configured and setup a Brane worker node!

If you are in charge of more worker nodes, you can repeat the steps in this chapter to add more. If you are also charged with setting up a central node, you can check the [previous chapter](./central-node.md) for central-node specific instructions.

Alternatively, you can also see if a proxy node is something for your use-case in the [next chapter](./proxy-node.md).

Otherwise, you can move on to other work! If you want to test your node like a normal user, you can go to the documentation for [Software Engineers](../../software-engineers/introduction.md) or [Scientists](../../scientists/introduction.md).
