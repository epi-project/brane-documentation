# Formal grammar
In this chapter, we present the formal grammar of Brane in [Backus-Naur form](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backus%E2%80%93Naur_form) (or something very much like it). This will show you what's possible to write in BraneScript and how the language is structured.

This chapter is very technical, and mostly suited for implementing a BraneScript parser. To find out more details about compiling BraneScript to the [Workflow Intermediate Representation](TODO) (WIR), consult the [next chapters](TODO).


## Conventions
As already stated, we will be using something like the Backus-Naur form in order to express the grammar (using the syntax as given on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backus%E2%80%93Naur_form)). However, we use certain conventions to structure the discussion.

First, BraneScript parsing is done in two-steps: first, a scanning or tokenization step, and then a parsing step of those tokens. We do the same here, where we will indicate tokens (i.e., terminals) in ALL CAPS. Non-terminals, which are parsed from the tokens, are indicated by CamelCaps.

Note that the order of tokens matters in that, in the case of ambiguity of parsing tokens, then tokens appearing first should be attempted first.

Then, we define an additional type of expression: regular expressions. These are given like literals (`"..."`), except that they are prefixed by an `r` (e.g., `r"..."`). If so, then the contents of the string should be understood as [TextMate regular expressions](https://macromates.com/manual/en/regular_expressions).

Note that the grammar does not encode operator precedence and associativity. Instead, this is defined separately [below](#operator-precedence--associativity).

Finally, we also use our own notion of comments, prefixed by a double slash (`//`). Anything from (and including) the double slash until the end of the line (or file) can be ignored for the official grammar.


## Grammar
Now follows the grammar of BraneScript.

## Operator precedence & associativity
The grammar above does not encode precedence and associativity for brevity purposes. Instead, they are given here in **Table 1**.

| Operator | Precedence | Associativity |
|----------|------------|---------------|
| &&       | 0          | Left          |
| \|\|     | 0          | Left          |
| ==       | 1          | Left          |
| !=       | 1          | Left          |
| <        | 2          | Left          |
| >        | 2          | Left          |
| <=       | 2          | Left          |
| >=       | 2          | Left          |
| +        | 3          | Left          |
| -        | 3          | Left          |
| *        | 4          | Left          |
| /        | 4          | Left          |
| %        | 4          | Left          |
| !        | 5          | Unary         |
| -        | 5          | Unary         |

_**Table 1**: Operator precedence and associativity for BraneScript. An operator with a higher precedence will bind stronger, and an operator with left-associativity will create parenthesis on the left._


## Next
The compilation of BraneScript to the WIR, and thus details about how to interpret the AST obtained by parsing BraneScript, are discussed in the [next chapter](./scoping.md).

Alternatively, if you want to know what BraneScript can be instead of what it is, refer to the [Future work](./future.md)-chapter.
